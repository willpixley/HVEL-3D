# HVEL-3D
The HVEL 3D Graphing program uses Python to clean, format, and plot data from the Hank Virtual Environments Lab AR multi-lane study. 

HVEL-3D takes an Excel file as input and returns a formatted 3D graph that shows safe vs. unsafe gaps, proportion of times a specific gap was crossed, and number of times the gap was crossed. HVEL-3D can be run through terminal, as an executable, or through your IDE of choice.

To use, install pandas, plotly.express, PyQt6, numpy, and sys.
